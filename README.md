# JPMC-certificate
This is the certificate of the virtual internship I did at JP Morgan Chase. 
It was a wonderful experience and I got hands-on experience working as a Software Development Engineer. 
The program was based on analysis of stocks and their prices.
I faced a lot of errors so had to refer the net for troubleshooting the errors also tried to solve the errors on my own 
when nothing was left to do.
